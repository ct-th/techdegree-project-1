        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I currently work as a photographer, but have always been interested in code. I really like to share photos over the internet, and have always kept up with the current technological trends relating to photography.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved taking things apart, and trying to put them back together, and really like to understand how things work. I look forward to doing the same with websites in the future!</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm really interested in getting better at front-end development, focusing mostly on:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to use these skills to build sites for myself, and possibly take on some small freelance web development projects.</p>
